## General info

This is my first project written in Go language. I read many projects written in Golang, which were supposed to be the **best** architecture in Go and I mixed them up. I think that the result is quite satisfying (my main technologies are Spring and Swift+Combine) though I see a lot of things to improve and I will try to do them. 

The app consists of layers responsible for business logic, communication with database, utilities layer and handlers for incoming requests. 

The reason why this app is written in Go is that it is very lightweight. It needs ridiculously small amount of memory and CPU resources in contrary to same app written in Java with Spring. Thanks to that I could deploy it on Cloud Run and reduce costs. 

Originally it was a university project but the result exceeded original requirements. App will be continuously developed and improved. 

Currently it is offline (due to quite high costs of whole environment on cloud), but if you want to try it please contact with me, so I'll make it all work online.
